# AndroidTFLite
 Running a deep convolutional neural network in Android using TensorFlow Lite. 
This project mainly aims at scanning the currency notes and detecting if they are real ones or fake. If the scanned currency is a fake currency, then it gives output as fake and if the currency is real, then it outputs its value through voice message and also it can be used to add the currency sum by scanning. This application is to be built using Random forest algorithm to train the model and android application development to provide user interface.
